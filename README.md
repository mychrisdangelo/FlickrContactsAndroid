Note:

Enormously useful to my learning the Android platform was [Android Programming: Big Nerd Ranch Guide 2013](http://www.bignerdranch.com/book/android_the_big_nerd_ranch_guide). To understand the basics of Android programming I worked through nearly every one of the book's examples. The book's examples also provided a template for the end design of this project. I have cited the book's influence on each source code document.
